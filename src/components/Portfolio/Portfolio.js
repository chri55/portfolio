    synopsis: "A summary of research around harassment of Virtual AI and Robotic Influencers on Instagram",
    description: "During my time at Rutgers University, I participated in a research project for the Digital Studies department in which we researched harassment of Virtual Influencers on Instagram. We focused the research around the account of a character called '@lilmiquela'. This account claims to be a real being that is robotic, not unlike Sofia the Robot, however it is simply a 3D model of a character created by a company called Brud. Because of the ambiguity of facts surrounding this account it gets a lot of harassment, and we were interested to see what kind of harassment was most common for a virtual being to receive.",

    synopsis: "Research on distributed algorithms for mobile agents on a  geometric field.",
    description: "I collaborated on this project during my time as a research assistant at the Rutgers University CCIB. The aim was to build an application to simulate and visualize search-and-evacuate algorithms for mobile agents in a known geometry. We started with simulations on a disk, and from there moved to other regular polygons and the 1-dimensional line. The original was written in Javascript with D3.js, and later we rewrote the backend to utilize Python for the data simulation. (NOTE: The repo for this project is private as it belongs to Rutgers.)",

    title: "Squid Bounce",
    synopsis: "Pixi.js minigame inspired by Splatoon.",
    description: "To help me learn JavaScript when I first began, I did this as a side project and used a fun little JS game engine called Pixi.js. Currently, it has infinite levels, increasing difficulty, and a point system based on how high you've gotten. In the future I hope to make some custom textures using pixel art for the lava that follows the player. I also plan to implement platforms that interact with the player differently, such as ice for sliding landings and conveyor belts to increase difficulty. Overall, I learned a lot about Pixi.js and JavaScript as a whole.",

    description: "As part of the curriculum for The Odin Project, a series of courses about web development, I was asked to make a calculator in JavaScript using no libraries. I learned some very important lessons about how postfix notation is parsed and used in calculations. This currently support multi-operator expressions, decimal point numbers, and the 4 basic math functions.",
