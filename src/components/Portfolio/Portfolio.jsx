    description: "I collaborated on this project during my time as a research assistant at the Rutgers University CCIB. The aim was to build an application to simulate and visualize search-and-evacuate algorithms for mobile agents in a known geometry. We started with simulations on a disk, and from there moved to other regular polygons and the 1-dimensional line. The original was written in Javascript with D3.js, and later we rewrote the backend to utilize Python for the data simulation.",

    synopsis: "A summary of research around harassment of Virtual AI and Robotic Influencers on Instagram",
    description: "During my time at Rutgers University, I participated in a research project for the Digital Studies department in which we researched harassment of Virtual Influencers on Instagram. We focused the research around the account of a character called '@lilmiquela'. This account claims to be a real being that is robotic, not unlike Sofia the Robot, however it is simply a 3D model of a character created by a company called Brud. Because of the ambiguity of facts surrounding this account it gets a lot of harassment, and we were interested to see what kind of harassment was most common for a virtual being to receive.",
